# Sentiment Analysis using BERT

This document (https://github.com/zen030/tech_review/blob/master/techreview.pdf) illustrates the use of the BERT pre-trained model to classify the sentiment of Twitter tweets.
The target audience of the document:
<ol>
 <li>The audience has no experience in BERT pre-training Model.</li>
 <li>The audience has the curiosity on how to use and fine-tune the BERT model for simple training tasks such as text classification (categorization).</li>
 <li>The audience has some basic understanding of Data Mining and Machine Learning.
<ul>
 <li>Understand the concept of Text Mining</li> 
 <li>Understand the concept of Training and Validation datasets</li>  
 <li>Understand the concept of F1-Score evaluation</li> 
</ul></li>  
<li>The audience has a basic knowledge of Python 3, Porch usage, and Jupyter Notebook.</li>
<li>And of course, the audience who is looking forward to spending fun time with Python code!</li>
</ol>


The main sources of inspiration for this document are the following Internet sources:

<li>Cousera course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/sentiment-analysis-bert/home/welcome</li>
<li>An article about BERT fine-tuning: https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/</li>
</ol>

This document combines BERT implementation and concepts from both sources into a single document. I hope this document will be useful for everyone new to the BERT world!
